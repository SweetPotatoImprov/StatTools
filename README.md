StatTools
============

Tools for the analysis of field experiments data (mainly R code). To use these tools you must download all the R functions in your working directory. If you are new to R, you will need to install the software first. Download the last version of R from [here](http://cran.r-project.org/).

AMMI
-------------------------

Set of functions to run AMMI (Gollob, H. R., 1968).

CheckConsis
-------------------------

Set of rules to check for consistency of sweetpotato field experiments data in R.
Data labels must be defined as specified in the PROCEDURES FOR THE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF SWEETPOTATO TRIALS document.

CheckData
-------------------------

Set of functions to check experimental data. These functions are needed to check data for posterior analysis with AMMI, Tai, or for missing values estimation.

GoodDataPractices
-----------------

Some recommendations for good data management and statistical analysis. I hope these recommendations will help you to save time and minimize the number of mistakes.

IndexSelection
--------------

Proposed Selection Indices for Applied Breeding Programs.

MissValEst
----------

Set of functions to estimate missing values for field experiments data.

RegStab
-------

Function to run the regression stability analysis (Yates and Cochran, 1938, Finlay and Wilkinson, 1963).

Resp2Selection
--------------

Set of scripts to find the optimum number of replications to get the maximum response to selection.

Tai
----------

R code to perform the Tai stability analysis (Tai, G. C. C., 1971).
